    "full_section_content": "What\u2019s the best way to create a PDF? You can create PDFs from documents printed on paper, Microsoft Word documents, InDesign\u00ae files, digital images, and more. Di\ufb00erent types of sources have di\ufb00erent tools available for PDF conversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in the Print dialog box. If a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft Excel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is already open, you don\u2019t have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF. Every PDF balances e\ufb03ciency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the balance between the file size and the quality is critical to your task, you must use an appropriate conversion method. For example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat applies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to those settings. If you want more control over the process, you\u2019ll want to use another method."

    "full_section_content": "You can select various settings to ensure that your PDF has the best balance between file size, resolution, conformity to specific standards, and other factors. The settings you select depend on your goals for the PDF that you are creating. For example, a PDF intended for high-quality commercial printing requires di\ufb00erent settings than a PDF intended only for onscreen viewing and quick downloading over the Internet. Once selected, these settings apply across PDFMaker, Acrobat, and Acrobat Distiller. However, some settings are limited to specific contexts or file types. For example, PDFMaker options can vary among the di\ufb00erent types of Microsoft O\ufb03ce applications. For convenience, you can select one of the conversion presets available in Acrobat. You can also create, define, save, and reuse custom presets that are uniquely suited to your purposes. For scanned documents, you can choose from Autodetect Color Mode or several scanning presets that are optimized for scanning documents and images in color or black and white. You can modify these presets or use your own custom scanning settings. There are various ways to create a PDF file using Acrobat. You can generate a PDF quickly using the convert to PDF tool, menu commands, dragging-and-dropping files onto the Acrobat application icon, or converting clipboard data."

To address this, improve images using other tools before adding them to PDF documents. If the original font isn't available, font substitutions may occur, altering the text's appearance. To maintain consistency across devices, we suggest you use the available fonts or embed them within the PDF. You can also enhance document accessibility using Acrobat's features, such as adding alternative text for images and proper content tagging.

    "full_section_content": "Editing a scanned PDF can be complicated if it includes low-quality text or images, non- editable text, line breaks, or complex formatting. Other inhibiting factors include compatibility issues, security restrictions, and large file sizes, which are more prevalent in PDFs created from scanned images. To streamline the process, consider the following best practices and guidelines before editing a scanned document: Check the accuracy of optical character recognition (OCR) output. When you open a scanned document, Acrobat automatically runs OCR in the background to make the document editable. Before editing, review the document to ensure that the content is accurate and complete. If necessary, rescan the document using the Scan & OCR > Recognize Text tool to improve the output. Enhance image quality. If the scanned PDF contains low-quality images, use the Enhance scanned file or Enhance camera image feature to improve the quality of images before attempting to edit the document. For more information, see Scan documents to PDF. Use the correct font and formatting. When editing the document, ensure that the font and formatting of the edited text match the original document as closely as possible. If you don't have the desired fonts on your computer, see Add fonts to your computer. Remove security restrictions. If the scanned PDF has security restrictions that prevent editing, remove these restrictions before attempting to edit the document. To know how to remove security from a PDF, see Unlock a PDF. Avoid editing complex elements. If the scanned PDF contains tables, graphs, or images, avoid unnecessary edits that could alter the layout or formatting of these elements. Check for compatibility issues. Ensure that the version of Adobe Acrobat you're using is compatible with the scanned PDF. If you encounter compatibility issues, try updating Adobe Acrobat. For more information, see System requirements. Save a backup copy. Always save a backup copy of the original scanned PDF before making any edits. Revert to the original document if any issues arise during the editing process."

The original file is not modified. Instead, Acrobat creates an autosave file of changes, which includes all the changes you made to the open file since the last automatic save. The amount of new information that the autosave file contains depends on how frequently Acrobat saves the autosave file. If you set the autosave interval to 15 minutes, you could lose the last 14 minutes of your work if a problem occurs. Frequent automatic saving prevents loss of data, and is especially useful if you make extensive changes to a document, such as by adding comments. You can apply autosave changes to the original files when you restart Acrobat. When you close, save manually, or revert to the last-saved version of a file, the autosave file is deleted. Note: If you use assistive technology, such as a screen reader, you may want to disable the Autosave feature so that you don\u2019t lose your place when the file is reloaded. The Autosave feature won\u2019t work in the following cases: A document that has its security changed. You must save the document to re-enable automatic saving of document changes.

This option is available only in PostScript (PS) format. ASCII or Binary Specifies the output format of image data. Binary output yields smaller files, but not all workflows can accommodate binary output. PostScript Specifies the level of PostScript compatibility. Use Language Level 3 only if the target output device supports it. Language Level 2 is suitable for EPS files placed in another document and color-separated as part of that document. Use Language Level 2 for EPS files that you import into Microsoft applications. Font Inclusion Specifies the fonts to be included in the PostScript. Embedded fonts are taken from the PDF; the referenced fonts are taken from the computer. Include Comments Preserves the appearance of comments in the resulting PostScript file. Convert True Type to Type 1 Converts TrueType fonts to Type 1 fonts in the resulting PostScript file. Include Preview Specifies if a TIFF preview is created for the resulting EPS file.

In addition, please always use your judgment to evaluate generated output and any source attributions. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader generative AI features are built upon powerful, emerging large language model technologies that may generate outputs that are inaccurate or misleading, or otherwise reflect content that does not represent Adobe\u2019s views. This is especially true if you try to use these features to generate outputs that are unrelated to your source document. Do not use generative AI features to seek legal, medical, financial, or other kinds of professional advice or any opinions, judgments, or recommendations without conducting your own independent consultation or research. Generative AI features cannot replace advice provided by a qualified professional and do not form any such relationship (for example, an attorney-client relationship)."

Attribution can take the form of clickable citations or other helpful cues indicating where generated information came from. However, because the AI Assistant is powered by generative AI models, and the technology is still evolving and not perfect, not all answers are helpful or accurate. As a result, the AI Assistant may not find and display answers to your questions \u2014 even when the information is in your document. And rarely, the AI Assistant may provide incorrect attributions. For example, you may receive a clickable citation or cue that takes you to an unrelated section instead of providing helpful information on where the answer came from in the document. Please double-check all AI-generated responses. Please note that in our current version, if the language of the question and response is different than the language of your document, AI Assistant won't provide any attribution. In such scenarios, you can try asking questions in the language of the document to receive clickable citations in the response."

This is an ongoing process, and we will continue to work together with our customers and community to harness the power of this new technology responsibly. Content usage and handling practices This FAQ addresses Adobe\u2019s content usage and handling practices specific to improving generative AI capabilities in Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat Reader. For purposes of this FAQ, references to \u201cgenerative AI capabilities\u201d are specific to Acrobat AI Assistant and Generative summary only. To learn more about how Adobe may analyze metadata and information about your prompt (for example, question type) and document (for example, number of pages, document structure, document type, and other document statistics) for product improvement purposes in Document Cloud generally, see our content analysis FAQ. For more information about Adobe\u2019s security, privacy, and AI ethics practices, see the Adobe Document Cloud security page (and other materials in our Trust Center), the Adobe Privacy Policy, and the Adobe AI Ethics page, respectively. Will adobe ever look at your content while you\u2019re using generative ai in acrobat and acrobat reader? We do not look at your document, prompt(s), or generated responses except in the instances described below. Reported content, bugs, or vulnerabilities. When you report content (e.g., for being harmful, illegal, offensive, etc.), we investigate it by manually reviewing the document, prompt(s), and generated responses to make adjustments to the service to address the issue. User-Provided Feedback. For Acrobat Individual users* and Acrobat Reader users that provide feedback, you have the option to share with us your document, prompt(s), and generated responses during a document session for product improvement purposes that do not include training a Large Language Model (\u201cLLM\u201d). Examples of product improvement include improving the operability of generative AI in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader, as well as reducing hallucination, bias, and toxicity. If you do not wish to share your content, please uncheck the product improvement checkbox when you first provide feedback on a document. If manual review of your content takes place, a limited group of trained Adobe personnel examine the content within an encrypted repository with access controls. What steps do we take to protect your content when you share it with us as part of providing feedback? When you share your documents, textual prompts, and the generated responses with us when providing feedback, we take steps to filter out personal information by applying data masking procedures to this content (i.e., replacing personal information with predefined categories using Named Entity Recognition, e.g., replacing \u201cJohn Smith\u201d with \u201cPERSON\u201d) prior to using the content for product improvement. Content is stored for 30 days in an encrypted, siloed, Adobe-controlled environment with strict access controls. You can always contact us via the form in our Privacy Policy if you want us to delete this data sooner, or if you want to opt out of the use of your content to improve generative AI capabilities in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader. If you flag content as being harmful, illegal, or offensive or if you contribute content as feedback, how long do we retain that content? The flagged content is only retained for 30 days unless we have other legal reasons to retain it access as described in our Privacy Policy. You can always contact us via the form in our Privacy Policy if you want us to delete this data sooner. Do acrobat\u2019s generative ai features process my documents when i launch the application or open a file in the application? No. To access Acrobat generative AI features, you must sign into your Adobe account and agree to the Adobe Generative AI User Guidelines surfaced in a one-time \u201cGetting Started\u201d experience when you first interact with such features in Acrobat. This activates the generative AI feature set in Acrobat for all subsequent document sessions. After activation, a user must engage AI Assistant or generative summary on a specific file before processing takes place. If I\u2019m signed into my adobe account, does acrobat\u2019s generative ai features automatically start processing my documents when I launch the application, or open a file in the application? No. Acrobat\u2019s generative AI features, like AI Assistant, do not start automatically processing any of your documents upon application launch or upon opening a file into the application. A user must first activate the generative AI feature set through a one-time \u201cGetting Started\u201d in- app experience as described above. After activation, a user must engage AI Assistant or generative summary on a specific file before processing takes place. Note: The generative AI features are only available in English for users with Individual or Teams entitlements. Users with Enterprise entitlements may only receive Acrobat generative AI features when their admin assigns them with a paid or trial license, or if they are accepted into one of the programs in our private beta. You can disable the generative AI feature by following the steps outlined here. Once disabled, no documents will be processed through generative AI in Acrobat until you activate the feature set again. What LLMS are we leveraging to power generative ai in acrobat? With AI Assistant in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader, Adobe takes an LLM-agnostic approach, selecting best-in-class technologies that address a range of customer use cases. We currently have integrated the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service with our proprietary technologies to provide generative AI capability in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader. Does adobe concurrently train any large language models (\u201cLLMS\u201d) with your content while you're using generative ai features in acrobat? No. Acrobat does not train any LLMs on your content concurrent to your interactions with generative AI in Acrobat. Prompts provided to AI Assistant do not modify the underlying model. Your content will not be used to train any LLMs that deliver Acrobat\u2019s generative AI capability. For more information, please refer to the questions above in this help section (Content Usage and Handling Practices). Note: Adobe does not use content from an organization or school account for product improvement for generative AI unless otherwise agreed to by the organization or school. Managing chat history What is chat history? Acrobat now allows you to reference past conversations you had with AI Assistant. Chat history includes your textual prompts and generated responses for a specific document or a set of documents you selected, also termed a Collection. How can I see my chat history? Chat history includes your past conversations with AI Assistant and is linked to either a single document or a Collection. To view these conversations, simply open the document or Collection from your list of recent files. The chat history might still contain content from documents you've removed from a Collection. The AI Assistant may also use this chat history as context when responding to your prompts. Where is my chat history stored? It's stored on your local device for Acrobat and Reader\u2019s desktop, mobile, and online apps and in Adobe cloud storage for Acrobat\u2019s online app. It permits you to easily access the conversation to review or continue using AI Assistant. Can I export my chat history in AI Assistant? Export is not currently available. Instead, you can copy the chat history or specific generated responses into your text editor of choice. Learn more here. How can I clear my chat history in AI Assistant? You can clear chat history from the More menu for each individual document or a Collection. Selecting Clear chat history will delete all of the chat history, meaning the document overview, textual prompts (suggested by AI Assistant or provided by you), and generated responses. Can I disable chat history in AI Assistant? This is currently not available to users. Can i share my chat history with others? No, you can\u2019t share your chat history with other users. What happens if I disconnect acrobat from other third-party cloud storage services such as google drive or OneDrive? You'll no longer be able to access your third-party cloud storage files in Acrobat and the AI Assistant chats associated with them."

Add a file: Upload (by search or drag-and-drop) the primary file that you are using to build your agreement template. The selector on the right of the Select a file button allows you to choose from the source where the file resides. The default is your local system. Once a file is selected, the configuration page loads. 3. Add participants: 1. List the participants required. The Sign action is assigned by default. The Sign action allows the participant to enter field data and sign the agreement. Up to 50 participants are supported. Each participant listed receives their own agreement. 2. Enter recipient email addresses followed by commas, or copy and paste a list of email addresses into the Email field. 3. Configure participant authentication by clicking the key icon to the right of the participant. Email is the default authentication method for confirming the identity of each participant and is sufficient to obtain a legal signature in most cases. Password authentication can be added to increase security. When configured, the participant must enter the password before they can interact with the agreement. 4. . (Optional) Add yourself and/or CC'd parties Click Add me to add yourself as a counter signer. Click Add cc to add people you want to be copied when the agreement is sent and complete. 5. (Optional) Add additional files if needed. The initial file selected to start the agreement template is already attached. Upload any additional file(s) that you require. Multiple files can be uploaded. All files uploaded are concatenated into one file for the final agreement. The order the files are listed dictates how the final agreement will look. You can click and drag the files to sort them. You must share this password with the participants out-of-band. 6. Add Agreement Details: Name your agreement. All agreements generated from the Send in bulk template will have the same agreement name. Change the default text in the Message field as appropriate. 7. Edit the Agreement settings (Optional): By default, agreements do not require a password to view the completed agreement, nor do they have reminders set for participants Select Add access password if you require recipients to enter a password to open and view the signed PDF file. Select Set Reminder to set the frequency of reminders to be sent until the agreement is completed. 8. Click Next in the upper right corner of the window. The document is now ready to add any fields that you want the signers to fill in or sign. Note:   If you have added multiple files, the files are converted into PDFs and combined into a single document. The combined document is opened for you to add fields. 9. Prepare the Agreement and Add Fields: You can now add any necessary fields to the agreement. Remember that a Signature field must be placed for each signer (including internal counter-singers). There are two methods to apply fields: 1. Simple Authoring is loaded by default in most instances. Simple authoring: Is limited to the most common types of fields: Text input (All Text fields are flagged as Required) Signature Signer's name (Printed) Signer's email Signature date (Read-Only; Supplied by the system) Checkbox Places fields anywhere you click on the document. Allows resizing of fields by clicking the bottom right corner of the field (blue triangle) and dragging the field to size. 2. Advanced Authoring can be enabled by selecting the toggle in the upper right corner.

Adobe Acrobat supports a range of solutions for electronic and digital signatures. These solutions include certificate signatures that let you sign PDF files with a certificate-based digital ID. Certificate signatures are also known as digital signatures. Acrobat lets you create your certificate ID. However, the common approach is to work with a certificate ID from a trusted third-party certificate authority. Additional signing options in Acrobat include integration with Adobe Acrobat Sign. Why use certificate signatures? Many business transactions, including financial, legal, and other regulated transactions, require high assurance when signing documents. When documents are distributed electronically, it's important that recipients can: Verify document authenticity\u2014confirming the identity of each person who signed the document Verify document integrity\u2014confirming that the document has not been altered in transit Certificate-based signatures provide both of these security services. Many businesses and governments have chosen to set up a certificate-based digital signature infrastructure within their organization. They use third-party certificate authorities to provide independent identity validation. Examples include: For instance, companies in the European Union who need to comply with advanced or qualified electronic signature requirements in eIDAS e-signature regulation or the ETSI PAdES standard (PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures). What can I do with certificate IDs? Once certificate-based digital IDs have been provided to end users, they can use Acrobat or Acrobat Reader software to sign PDF files and validate files they receive from others. Sign documents Sign PDF files using certificate IDs Place a signature box anywhere on the page Add multiple signatures to a page Add a time stamp to the document when working with a configured timestamp server Certify a document with a visible or hidden signature so that recipients can verify authenticity with or without seeing a visible signature on the page Automatically embed certificate data to support long-term validation Validate documents Validate all signatures, confirming the identity of everyone who signed the document Validate document integrity by tracking all previously signed versions of a document to verify changes made during the document\u2019s lifecycle Set privileges and permissions for others Certify a document while leaving portions of it available for form filling, signatures, or comments Use Acrobat Pro software to enable users of Reader 9 or later to sign with certificate Use Acrobat Standard or Pro to encrypt a PDF document with a certificate ID to restrict usage such as printing, editing, or copying"

Certified Document Services: Certified Document Services (CDS) was the predecessor to the AATL. Content Security Library: Extensive documentation on Adobe certificate signature administration. Managing Digital IDs: Help pages for digital ID management. A certificate-based signature, like a conventional handwritten signature, identifies the person signing a document. Unlike a handwritten signature, a certificate-based signature is difficult to forge because it contains encrypted information that is unique to the signer. It can be easily verified and informs recipients whether the document was modified after the signer initially signed it. To sign a document with a certificate-based signature, you must obtain a digital ID or create a self-signed digital ID in Acrobat or Acrobat Reader. The digital ID contains a private key and a certificate with a public key, and more. The private key is used to create the certificate-based signature. The certificate is a credential that is automatically applied to the signed document. The signature is verified when recipients open the document. When you apply a certificate-based signature, Acrobat uses a hashing algorithm to generate a message digest, which it encrypts using your private key. Acrobat embeds the encrypted message digest in the PDF, certificate details, signature image, and a document version when signed. Certificate-based signature in a PDF form"

Digitally sign When you Digitally sign with a certificate, the signature is considered an approval signature. Certify (visible or invisible signatures) Certify options provide a higher level of document control than Digitally sign. For documents that require certification, you must certify the documents before others sign them. If a document has already been signed, the Certify options are disabled. When you certify a document, you can control the types of changes other people can make. You can certify with or without displaying a signature. Signatures made with the Certify or Digitally sign options comply with data protection standards specified by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). In addition, both signature types comply with the PDF Advanced Electronic Signature (PAdES) standard. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader provide an option to change the default signing format to a CAdES format. This option is compliant with Part 3 of the PAdES standard. The timestamp capability and native support for long-term validation of signatures (introduced in Acrobat 9.1) is in compliance with Part 4 of the PAdES standard.

What is a digital signature? Digital signatures are a secure and efficient way to electronically sign and authenticate documents, ensuring their authenticity and integrity. By using digital signatures, you can sign documents quickly and easily, and be confident that they can\u2019t be tampered with or forged. Why validate a digital signature? When you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature to verify the signer and the signed content. Depending on how you\u2019ve configured your application, validation may occur automatically. Signature validity is determined by checking the authenticity of the signature\u2019s digital ID certificate status and document integrity. To verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are trusted. The validity of the signing certificate is also checked based on the user's Acrobat or Acrobat Reader settings. To verify document integrity, the validator checks if the signed content was altered after signing. If changes were made, the verification ensures that the signer allowed the changes."

    "full_section_content": "Long-term signature validation allows you to verify the signature's validity long after the document was signed. To achieve this, all the necessary elements for signature validation must be embedded in the signed PDF. These elements can be embedded during the document signing process or added afterward. If certain information is not included in the PDF, the signature can only be validated for a limited time because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked. When a certificate expires, the issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing revocation status, rendering the signature unverifiable. The necessary elements for signature validity include the signing certificate chain, certificate revocation status, and possibly a timestamp. If these elements are embedded during signing, the signature can be validated without requiring external resources. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader can embed the necessary elements if available, and the PDF creator must enable usage rights for Acrobat Reader users by going to the hamburger menu   (Windows) or the Acrobat menu (macOS) > Save as other > Acrobat Reader extended PDF. Note: Embedding timestamp information requires an appropriately configured timestamp server. In addition, the signature validation time must be set to Secure Time by navigating to Preferences > Security > Advanced Preferences > Verification tab. CDS certificates can add verification information, such as revocation and timestamp into the document without requiring any configuration from the signer. However, the signer must be online to fetch the appropriate information."

For instance, a company official may sign a contract on a laptop while traveling without internet access. When internet access is later available, anyone validating the signature can add timestamping and revocation information to the PDF. Subsequent signature validations can also make use of this information. To add verification information after signing: 1. Ensure that your computer can connect to the appropriate network resources, and then right-click the signature in the PDF. 2. Select Add Verification Information. Information and methods used to include this long-term validation (LTV) information in the PDF comply with Part 4 of the ETSI 102 778 PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures (PAdES) standard.

If you move the PDF to a new location, the embedded file automatically goes with it. To view an attachment, the reader must have an application installed that can open the attachment.
