What’s the best way to create a PDF? 
You can create PDFs from documents printed on paper, Microsoft Word documents, InDesign® 
files, digital images, and more. Diﬀerent types of sources have diﬀerent tools available for PDF 
conversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in 
the Print dialog box. 
If a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft 
Excel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is 
already open, you don’t have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF. 
Every PDF balances eﬃciency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the 
balance between the file size and the quality is critical to your task, you must use an 
appropriate conversion method. 
For example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat 
applies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to those settings. 
If you want more control over the process, you’ll want to use another method.

Balance PDF file size and quality 
You can select various settings to ensure that your PDF has the best balance between file size, 
resolution, conformity to specific standards, and other factors. The settings you select depend 
on your goals for the PDF that you are creating. For example, a PDF intended for high-quality 


[Page 6 - Normal Text]
commercial printing requires diﬀerent settings than a PDF intended only for onscreen viewing 
and quick downloading over the Internet. 
Once selected, these settings apply across PDFMaker, Acrobat, and Acrobat Distiller. 
However, some settings are limited to specific contexts or file types. For example, PDFMaker 
options can vary among the diﬀerent types of Microsoft Oﬃce applications. 
For convenience, you can select one of the conversion presets available in Acrobat. You can 
also create, define, save, and reuse custom presets that are uniquely suited to your purposes. 
For scanned documents, you can choose from Autodetect Color Mode or several scanning 
presets that are optimized for scanning documents and images in color or black and white. 
You can modify these presets or use your own custom scanning settings. 
There are various ways to create a PDF file using Acrobat. You can generate a PDF quickly 
using the convert to PDF tool, menu commands, dragging-and-dropping files onto the 
Acrobat application icon, or converting clipboard data. 
 
 


[Page 7 - Normal Text]
Convert a file to PDF using Acrobat menu 
commands 
 
1. Do any of the following: 
• 
In Acrobat, select Create from the global toolbar. 
 
 
The Create a PDF tool opens. On the left rail, Single file is  
selected by default. Choose the Select a file button. 
 


[Page 8 - Normal Text]
• 
Select the hamburger menu 
 > Create > PDF from File (Windows), 
or File > Create > PDF from File (macOS). 
2. In the Open dialog box, select the ﬁle that you want to convert. You can browse all ﬁle 
types or select a speciﬁc type from the Files Of Type drop-down menu. 
 
3. Optionally, select Advanced settings to change the conversion options if you're 
converting an image file to PDF. The options available vary depending on the file type. 
  
Note:  
The Advanced settings button is unavailable if you choose All Files as the file type or 
if no conversion settings are available for the selected file type. (For example, the 
Advanced settings button is unavailable for Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel files.) 
 
4. Select Create to convert the ﬁle to a PDF. 
 
Depending on the type of ﬁle being converted, the authoring applicaƟon opens 
automaƟcally, or a progress dialog box appears. If the ﬁle is in an unsupported format, a 
message appears, telling you that the ﬁle cannot be converted to PDF. 
 
5. When the new PDF opens, choose the hamburger menu 
  > Save or Save 
As (Windows), File > Save or File > Save As (macOS), and then select a name and 
location for the PDF. 
 


[Page 9 - Normal Text]
Note:  
When naming a PDF that’s intended for electronic distribution, limit the filename to eight 
characters (with no spaces) and include the .pdf extension. This action ensures that email 
programs or network servers don’t truncate the filename and that the PDF opens as expected. 
 
Convert a file to PDF using the Convert to PDF tool 
 
1. In Acrobat, select All tools > Convert to PDF. 
2. In the file explorer window that appears, select the file you want to convert to PDF, 
and select Open. 
3. The selected file is converted to PDF and opens in Acrobat. Choose the hamburger 
menu 
  > Save or Save As (Windows), File > Save or File > Save As (macOS), 
and then select a name and location for the PDF. 
 
Drag-and-drop to create PDFs 
This method is best for small, simple files, such as small image files and plain text files, when 
the balance between file size and output quality is not important. You can use this technique 
with many other types of files, but you cannot adjust any conversion settings during the 
process. 
1. Select the icons of one or more files in the Windows Explorer or macOS Finder. 
2. Drag the file icons onto the Acrobat application icon. Or (Windows only) drag the files 
into the open Acrobat window. 
  
If a message appears saying that the file could not be opened in Acrobat, then that 
file type cannot be converted to PDF by the drag-and-drop method. Use one of the 
other conversion methods for that file. 
  
Note:  
You can also convert PostScript and EPS files to PDF by dragging them onto 
the Acrobat window or the Acrobat application icon. 
3. Save the PDF. 
  
 


[Page 10 - Normal Text]
Note:  
(Windows only) You can also right-click a file in Windows Explorer and select Convert 
to Adobe PDF. 
 
Convert clipboard content to PDF 
You can create PDFs from text and images that you copy from applications on macOS or 
Windows. 
1. Capture content in the Clipboard: 
• 
Use the copy command in the applications. 
• 
Press the PrintScreen key (Windows). 
• 
Use the Screenshot utility (Applications > Utilities > Screenshot), and 
choose Edit > Copy to place the content on the clipboard (macOS). 
• 
In a PDF file, you can select objects using the Edit Object tool (All 
tools > Use print production > Edit object), and then copy the selected 
objects. 
• 
 
2. In Acrobat, choose Create > Clipboard > Create, or choose All tools > Create a 
PDF > Clipboard > Create. 
  
Note:  
The PDF from Clipboard command appears only when content is copied to the 
Clipboard. If the Clipboard is empty, the command is disabled. 
 
 
 


[Page 11 - Normal Text]
Create a blank PDF 
You can create a blank PDF, rather than beginning with a file, a clipboard image, or scanning. 
This process can be useful for creating a one-page PDF. For longer, more complex, or heavily 
formatted documents, it’s better to create the source document in an application that offers 
more layout and formatting options, such as Adobe InDesign or Microsoft Word. 
Do any of the following: 
• 
In Acrobat, select Create from the global bar. 
 
The Create a PDF tool opens. On the leŌ rail, select Blank page, and then select Create. 
 
• 
Select the hamburger menu 
 > Create > Blank Page (Windows), 
or File > Create > Blank Page (macOS). 
Acrobat creates a blank page PDF. 


[Page 12 - Normal Text]
Note:  
To add a blank page to an existing PDF, open the PDF and then choose Edit > Organize 
pages > Insert > Blank page. 
 
Create multiple PDFs from multiple files  
You can create multiple PDFs from multiple native files, including files of different supported 
formats, in one operation. This method is useful when you must convert a large number of files 
to PDF. 
Note: When you use this method, Acrobat applies the most recently used conversion settings 
without offering you access to those settings. If you want to adjust the conversion settings, do 
so before using this method. 
1. In Acrobat, select Create from the global bar. 
2. The Create a PDF tool opens. On the leŌ rail, select MulƟple ﬁles > Create mulƟple 
PDF ﬁles, and then select Next.  
3. Choose Add Files > Add Files or Add Folders, and then select the ﬁles or folder. 
4. Select OK. The Output opƟons dialog box appears. 
5. In the Output OpƟons dialog box, specify your target folder and ﬁlename 
preferences, and then select OK. 
Using PDFMaker within an authoring application is a simple, one-click procedure. It involves 
clicking an Acrobat PDFMaker toolbar button or choosing a command on the Adobe PDF menu.  
 
About Acrobat PDFMaker 
PDFMaker is an Acrobat feature that operates within many business applications, such as 
Microsoft Office applications, AutoCAD, and Lotus Notes. When you install Acrobat, 
PDFMaker controls appear in the work area of the authoring application. 
Note:  Some PDFMaker features are not available in certain versions of the authoring 
applications. For a comparison chart, see Compatible web browsers and PDFMaker 
applications | Acrobat, Reader. 
 
 
 


[Page 13 - Normal Text]
Using Create PDF cloud service for PDF 
conversion 
Acrobat provides an option to use Adobe Create PDF cloud service in addition to a local 
conversion to convert Microsoft Word documents to PDFs. The created PDFs are high-quality 
and provide exceptional visual fidelity. They are well-tagged for better accessibility. They also 
include link recognition so that hyperlinks, internal document links, and tables of contents are 
created as live links.  
 
 
 


[Page 14 - Normal Text]
Convert a file to PDF using PDFMaker 
In Windows, Acrobat installs both an Acrobat PDFMaker toolbar and an Adobe PDF menu in 
many popular authoring applications. You can use either the toolbar buttons or the Adobe 
PDF menu (the Action menu in Lotus Notes) to create PDFs, but the menu also provides access 
to conversion settings. Although many of the conversion options are common to all authoring 
applications, a few are application-specific. 
For Microsoft Office applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, the options for creating 
PDFs are available from the Acrobat ribbon. 
Note:  
If you don’t see the PDF toolbar buttons in an application, you must show or activate the PDF 
toolbar. For other troubleshooting issues, see Troubleshoot Acrobat PDFMaker Problems. 
 
Show or activate PDFMaker in Microsoft Office and Lotus Notes 
If the PDF toolbar buttons don’t appear in your Microsoft Office or Lotus Notes application, use 
one of the following methods to show or activate PDFMaker.

Create PDFs from Word mail merges 
Mail merges from Word generate documents like form letters—for one common example—
that are personalized with information like the names and addresses of the recipients. With 
Acrobat PDFMaker, you can save steps by using a Word mail merge document and 
corresponding data file to output mail merges directly to PDF. You can even set up PDFMaker to 
attach those PDFs to email messages that are generated during the PDF-creation process. 
Note:  
For information on setting up files for the Word Mail Merge feature, see Microsoft Office Word 
Help. 
1. In Microsoft Word, open the template that you have created as the basis of your mail 
merge, or create the file using the Word Mail Merge toolbar and Mail Merge wizard, 
as needed. 
  
Note: Do not complete the mail merge in Word. Instead, set up and preview the mail 
merge as usual, so that you can verify that the merge will work correctly. 
2. Do one of the following: 
• 
Choose Acrobat > Mail Merge. 
• 
Click the Mail Merge To Adobe PDF button on the Mail Merge toolbar (View > 
Toolbars > Mail Merge). 
3. In the Acrobat PDFMaker - Mail Merge dialog box, select the options you want: 
  
• 
To specify which records in the data file will be imported into the merged 
files, select All or Current, or enter a range of pages by typing in 
the From and To boxes. 
• 
To name the PDF that will be created, type in the Specify PDF File Name box. 
  
Note: The PDF will be named using this text plus a series of numbers. For example, if 
you type JulyLetter in the Specify PDF File Name box, the mail-merged PDFs 
might appear as JulyLetter_0000123, JulyLetter_0000124, JulyLetter_0000125, and 
so forth. 
 
4. For Automatically Send Adobe PDF Files By Email, do one of the following: 
• 
To create and save merged PDFs for printing or sending later in email, leave 
the option deselected, and click OK. 
• 
To create merged PDFs and attach each one to an email message to the 
appropriate recipient, select this check box, and fill in the other Email options.

Convert Visio files to PDF (Acrobat Pro) 
PDFs created from Visio files preserve page sizes and support layers, searchable text, custom 
properties, links, bookmarks, and comments, depending on the conversion settings. To specify 
the properties 
• 
(Visio 2010) From the ribbon choose Acrobat > Preferences 
When you convert your Visio file, only shapes and guides that are printable and visible in the 
Visio drawing are converted and appear in the PDF. Shapes are converted regardless of their 
protection or behavior. Shape custom properties can be converted to PDF object data. 
When you convert the Visio file to a PDF, you can preserve all or just some layers, or you can 
flatten all layers. If you flatten layers, the PDF will look like the original drawing, but won’t 
contain any layer information. When flattened, the contents of only visible and printable layers 
will appear in the converted PDF. 
 
Convert Visio files 
1. If you want to change the PDFMaker conversion settings, do the following. (For 
information about a setting, place the pointer over the setting to display a tool tip 
below.) 
• 
(Visio 2010) Choose Acrobat > Preferences 
2. If you want to convert each page in the Visio file to a bookmarked page in the PDF 
file, choose Adobe PDF > Convert All Pages In Drawing. If this option is deselected, 
only the current page is converted. 
3. Do one of the following: 
• 
(Visio 2010) Choose Acrobat > Create PDF. 
• 
(Visio 2010) Choose Acrobat > Convert To Adobe PDF.

• 
(Visio 2010) Choose Acrobat > Create and Send For Review. The file converts 
to an Adobe PDF file, and an email-based review process begins.  
4. If you want to include the custom properties of shapes, select that option. 
5. Click Continue. 
6. Select a layers option to retain or flatten layers in the resulting PDF, and 
click Continue.

What's the best way to create a PDF?

You can create PDFs from documents printed on paper, Microsoft Word documents, InDesign®
files, digital images, and more. Different types of sources have different tools available for PDF
conversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in
the Print dialog box.

If a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft
Excel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is
already open, you don't have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF.

Every PDF balances efficiency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the
balance between the file size and the quality is critical to your task, you must use an
appropriate conversion method.

For example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat
applies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to those settings.
If you want more control over the process, you'll want to use another method.

PDF creation methods by file type

Refer to the following lists to determine the methods available for the different types of files.

Balance PDF file size and quality

You can select various settings to ensure that your PDF has the best balance between file size,
resolution, conformity to specific standards, and other factors. The settings you select depend
on your goals for the PDF that you are creating. For example, a PDF intended for high-quality


[Page 6 - OCR Extracted Text]
commercial printing requires different settings than a PDF intended only for onscreen viewing
and quick downloading over the Internet.

Once selected, these settings apply across PDFMaker, Acrobat, and Acrobat Distiller.
However, some settings are limited to specific contexts or file types. For example, PDFMaker
options can vary among the different types of Microsoft Office applications.

For convenience, you can select one of the conversion presets available in Acrobat. You can
also create, define, save, and reuse custom presets that are uniquely suited to your purposes.

For scanned documents, you can choose from Autodetect Color Mode or several scanning
presets that are optimized for scanning documents and images in color or black and white.
You can modify these presets or use your own custom scanning settings.

There are various ways to create a PDF file using Acrobat. You can generate a PDF quickly
using the convert to PDF tool, menu commands, dragging-and-dropping files onto the
Acrobat application icon, or converting clipboard data.

3. Optionally, select Advanced settings to change the conversion options if you're
converting an image file to PDF. The options available vary depending on the file type.

Note:

The Advanced settings button is unavailable if you choose All Files as the file type or
if no conversion settings are available for the selected file type. (For example, the
Advanced settings button is unavailable for Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel files.)

4. Select Create to convert the file to a PDF.

Depending on the type of file being converted, the authoring application opens
automatically, or a progress dialog box appears. If the file is in an unsupported format, a
message appears, telling you that the file cannot be converted to PDF.

5. When the new PDF opens, choose the hamburger menu = > Save or Save
As (Windows), File > Save or File > Save As (macOS), and then select a name and
location for the PDF.


[Page 9 - OCR Extracted Text]
Note:

When naming a PDF that’s intended for electronic distribution, limit the filename to eight
characters (with no spaces) and include the .pdf extension. This action ensures that email
programs or network servers don’t truncate the filename and that the PDF opens as expected.

Convert a file to PDF using the Convert to PDF tool

1. In Acrobat, select All tools > Convert to PDF.

2. Inthe file explorer window that appears, select the file you want to convert to PDF,
and select Open.

3. The selected file is converted to PDF and opens in Acrobat. Choose the hamburger
menu = > Save or Save As (Windows), File > Save or File > Save As (macOS),
and then select a name and location for the PDF.

Drag-and-drop to create PDFs

This method is best for small, simple files, such as small image files and plain text files, when
the balance between file size and output quality is not important. You can use this technique
with many other types of files, but you cannot adjust any conversion settings during the
process.

1. Select the icons of one or more files in the Windows Explorer or macOS Finder.

2. Drag the file icons onto the Acrobat application icon. Or (Windows only) drag the files
into the open Acrobat window.

If a message appears saying that the file could not be opened in Acrobat, then that
file type cannot be converted to PDF by the drag-and-drop method. Use one of the
other conversion methods for that file.

Note:

You can also convert PostScript and EPS files to PDF by dragging them onto
the Acrobat window or the Acrobat application icon.

3. Save the PDF.


[Page 10 - OCR Extracted Text]
Note:

(Windows only) You can also right-click a file in Windows Explorer and select Convert
to Adobe PDF.

Convert clipboard content to PDF

You can create PDFs from text and images that you copy from applications on macOS or
Windows.

1. Capture content in the Clipboard:

e Use the copy command in the applications.
e Press the PrintScreen key (Windows).

e Use the Screenshot utility (Applications > Utilities > Screenshot), and

objects.

2. In Acrobat, choose Create > Clipboard > Create, or choose All tools > Create a
PDF > Clipboard > Create.

Note:

The PDF from Clipboard command appears only when content is copied to the
Clipboard. If the Clipboard is empty, the command is disabled.


[Page 11 - OCR Extracted Text]
Create a blank PDF
You can create a blank PDF, rather than beginning with a file, a clipboard image, or scanning.

This process can be useful for creating a one-page PDF. For longer, more complex, or heavily
formatted documents, it’s better to create the source document in an application that offers
more layout and formatting options, such as Adobe InDesign or Microsoft Word.

Do any of the following:

e In Acrobat, select Create from the global bar.

Create multiple PDFs from multiple files

You can create multiple PDFs from multiple native files, including files of different supported
formats, in one operation. This method is useful when you must convert a large number of files
to PDF.

Note: When you use this method, Acrobat applies the most recently used conversion settings
without offering you access to those settings. If you want to adjust the conversion settings, do
so before using this method.

1. In Acrobat, select Create from the global bar.

2. The Create a PDF tool opens. On the left rail, select Multiple files > Create multiple
PDF files, and then select Next.

3. Choose Add Files > Add Files or Add Folders, and then select the files or folder.
4. Select OK. The Output options dialog box appears.

5. Inthe Output Options dialog box, specify your target folder and filename
preferences, and then select OK.

Using PDFMaker within an authoring application is a simple, one-click procedure. It involves
clicking an Acrobat PDFMaker toolbar button or choosing a command on the Adobe PDF menu.

About Acrobat PDFMaker

PDFMaker is an Acrobat feature that operates within many business applications, such as
Microsoft Office applications, AutoCAD, and Lotus Notes. When you install Acrobat,
PDFMaker controls appear in the work area of the authoring application.

Note: Some PDFMaker features are not available in certain versions of the authoring
applications. For a comparison chart, see Compatible web browsers and PDFMaker
applications | Acrobat, Reader.

Convert a file to PDF using PDFMaker

In Windows, Acrobat installs both an Acrobat PDFMaker toolbar and an Adobe PDF menu in
many popular authoring applications. You can use either the toolbar buttons or the Adobe
PDF menu (the Action menu in Lotus Notes) to create PDFs, but the menu also provides access
to conversion settings. Although many of the conversion options are common to all authoring
applications, a few are application-specific.

For Microsoft Office applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, the options for creating
PDFs are available from the Acrobat ribbon.

Note:

If you don’t see the PDF toolbar buttons in an application, you must show or activate the PDF
toolbar. For other troubleshooting issues, see Troubleshoot Acrobat PDFMaker Problems.

Create PDFs from Word mail merges

Mail merges from Word generate documents like form letters—for one common example—
that are personalized with information like the names and addresses of the recipients. With
Acrobat PDFMaker, you can save steps by using a Word mail merge document and
corresponding data file to output mail merges directly to PDF. You can even set up PDFMaker to
attach those PDFs to email messages that are generated during the PDF-creation process.
